# Creating Masonry layout with CSS grid.

## overview.
I have recently came across this youtube video by kevin Powell on his youtube channel and he was talking about this amazing layout called the masonry layout or waterfall layout. So a month or so after watching this video I finally sat down to work on a fun project with this layout and I created this photo gallery of endangered species.

What is a masonry layout? A masonry layout aka *waterfall layout* (metaphor for how content flows down the page like a waterfall) is a pattern where content is packed together like a brick or stone wall (hence it's name "masonry"). The contents are usually arranged in fixed columns and no clear rows which gives it this eyecatching view of randomness. 

## Learning.
This project was a great way for me to learn the masonry layout and making this project I also got to read on the various endangered species on earth.
